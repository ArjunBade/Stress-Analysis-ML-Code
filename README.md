# Student Stress Analysis & Recommendation System

**A Data-Driven Approach to Classify and Recommend Solutions for Student Stress Using Machine Learning**

---

## Overview

This project aims to analyze stress levels among higher education students and provide personalized recommendations based on their responses. Using clustering algorithms and feature engineering techniques, the system identifies stress patterns and suggests coping strategies.

## Features

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
  Cleans and structures survey responses for analysis.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Extracts meaningful features from questionnaire data to improve model accuracy.

- **Machine Learning Algorithm:**  
  Implements K-Means Clustering to identify stress levels

- **Recommendation System:**  
  Based on cluster classification, the system provides suggestions for stress management.

- **Visualization:**  
  Generates stress distribution charts and cluster-based visual insights.

## How It Works

1. **Input:**  
   A CSV file containing student questionnaire responses (values between “Never” and “Always”).

2. **Processing:**  
   - Data cleaning and normalization  
   - Feature engineering  
   - Clustering to categorize stress levels

3. **Output:**  
   - Cluster assignment for each student  
   - Personalized recommendations for stress management
